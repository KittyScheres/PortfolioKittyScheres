        Hi, my name is Kitty Scheres.
        <br/><br/>
        I am a generalist games programmer with a special interest in virtual reality. I have 6.5 years of programming experience, 
        of which 2.5 are game-related. During my education at BUAS, I have worked on a couple solo and team-based projects.
        <br/><br/>
        According to team members I have worked with in the past, I am enjoyable to work with. 
        I am eager to share my knowledge on a subject when this is relevant, 
        I work to create a positive environment for me and my team members, and I provide insightful feedback.
    </p>
