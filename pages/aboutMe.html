<h1>AboutMe</h1>

<p id="description">
Hi, my name is Kitty Scheres.
<br/>
I am a generalist games programmer with a special interest in virtual reality. I have 6.5 years of programming experience, 
of which 2.5 are game-related. During my education at BUAS, I have worked on many solo and team-based projects.
<br/>
According to team members I have worked with in the past, I am enjoyable to work with. 
I am eager to share my knowledge on a subject when this is relevant, 
I work to create a positive environment for me and my team members, and I provide insightful feedback.
