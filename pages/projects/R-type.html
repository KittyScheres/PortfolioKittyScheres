            One of my <b>assignments for school</b> was to re-create a version of the arcade game R-Type within <b>6 weeks</b> using 
            only <b>C++</b> and a template for rendering the graphics to the screen and getting input from the player.

            In this project, I worked on the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collision between sphere colliders</li>
            <li>Collision between AABB colliders</li>
            <li>Collision between AABB and sphere colliders</li>
            <li>An implementation of the sweep and prune algorithm for optimizing collision</li>
            <li>Tilemap collision</li>
            <li>Tilemap rendering with a moving camera</li>
            <li>A simple state machine based enemy AI</li>
            <li>Catmull-rom spline based movement for enemies</li>
            <li>2D rotation using matrices</li>
        </ul>
