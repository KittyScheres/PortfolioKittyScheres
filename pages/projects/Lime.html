            One of my <b>school assignments</b> was to create a raytracer without flat surfaces, that runs on the CPU at a reasonable 
            framerate. I had <b>8 weeks</b> to complete this project and the entire project is made using <b>C++</b> and a template for rendering 
            the graphics to the screen and getting input from the user. The focus of the project was to learn the fundamentals of raytracing 
            and how to take something as performance-heavy as raytracing and how to make it more performant.

            The focus was to learn about the algorithms and math associated with withed style raytracing. The project includes

        <h2>Bounding volume hiarchy</h2>
        <p>
            Next to creating a raytracer, we also needed to work on making it more performant. One way I got a lot of performance 
            out of my raytracer was by applying an optimization structure to my scene to make it easier to see what geometry the 
            rays are colliding with. For my optimization structure, I used the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a Bounding volume hierarchy that contains all the geometry in the scene</li>
            <li>Making use of Surface Area Heuristics to find the optimal split for each bounding volume</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Multithreading</h2>
        <p>
            To squeeze a bit more performance out of my raytracer I decided to investigate multithreading. In the end, I was able 
            to setup a job system that collects jobs for rendering parts of the frame, once the entire frame is rendered it is 
            displayed to the user, and the jobs for the next frame are provided to the job system.
