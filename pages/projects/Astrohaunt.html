            Astrohaunt is the first school project I worked on where I worked together with artists and designers. This project was 
            <b>developed and released in 8 weeks</b>, during this project I took on the role of <b>gameplay programmer</b>. I worked
            on this project with <b>12 other developers</b> and we made it using the <b>Unreal engine</b> and the <b>blueprints 
            scripting language</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Astrohaunt is a spiritual successor to the game Paradroid. In this game, you’re in charge of clearing a haunted mansion 
            that has been launched into space. The ghosts in the mansion can be captured to gain extra abilities to aid you in the 
            clearing of the mansion.

    <div id="locatorMap">
        <h2>Locator map</h2>
        <p>
            One of the features I worked on was the locator map. This object could be used by the player to figure out where on 
            the current level they are. Interacting with the locator map would show the player a map of the current level. On this 
            map, there would be an image that would indicate where the player is currently located. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To make it easier to move the locations of the locators around in later iterations of the level, I created a system where 
            the current position of the player would dynamically be placed on the map. This is achieved by placing two anchors in the 
            level, these anchors march the boundary of the level. Using this boundary the locator can calculate the player's position 
            in the level and turn this into an X and Y coordinate for the marker on the map.

    <div id="roomTracking">
        <h2>Room selection for minigame</h2>
        <p>
            When the player starts the mini-game for capturing a ghost, they are locked into the room and the player and ghost are 
            placed across from each other. I worked on the system for keeping track of the room the player is in.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep track of the room the player is in, I created a blueprint that represents a room. This blueprint allows the 
            developer to spawn collision volumes that can be placed at the doors used to enter the room. These volumes will notify 
            the room that the player has entered. To lock the correct doors, the developer can also add references to the doors 
            surrounding the room.

    <div id="ghostAbsorption">
        <h2>Ghost absorption</h2>
        <p>
            In Astrohaunt, the player can capture ghosts and absorb their abilities. I created the setup for this feature. The player 
            character has a variable that contains an object that represents the current ability. This is either the standard ability 
            that contains the player's standard attack or one of the 3 ghost abilities the player gets from capturing a ghost. The 
            ability contains both an attack function that decides what attack gets performed by the player, and it also contains 
            modifiers that get applied to the player’s stats. 
        </p>

    <div id="gravityHole">
        <h2>Gravity hole</h2>
        <p>
            One of the hazards the player can run into is a vortex that pulls the player toward its center. The closer the player gets 
            to the center, the stronger the force that is applied to the player. I implemented this feature.

    <div id="healingPad">
        <h2>Healing pad</h2>
        <p>
            In Astrohaunt, the player can heal themselves by standing on top of a healing pad. As long as the player has enough points 
            to pay for more health or as long as the player is not at full health, the healing pad will continue to heal them. I 
            implemented this feature within the project.
