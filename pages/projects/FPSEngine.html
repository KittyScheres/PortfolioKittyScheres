            The wombat combat engine is a first-person shooter game engine I and 6 other people worked on over the duration of 16 weeks. 
            This engine was made to work on both Windows computers and the PlayStation 5 While working on the project I took on the 
            specialization of engine programmer. My main contributions to this project are related to the loading of level geometry and 
            entity data from TrenchBroomâ€™s BSP files and the implementation of Bullet physics for this project.

        <h2>Quack BSP-level file loading</h2>
        <p>
            As level editor for our engine, we decided to make use of the TrenchBroom level editor as the designers in our year were 
            using it to create quake levels, this allowed us to make use of their levels to test our engine features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quake and its levels have a lot of features, of these features the Wombat engine supports the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The loading and rendering of brush-based geometry</li>
            <li>The rendering of textures applied to the brushes</li>
            <li>The rendering of lightmaps applied to the brushes</li>
            <li>The loading of custom entities as defined in Trenchbroom</li>
            <li>The loading of brush-based entities as defined in TrenchBroom</li>
            <li>The loading of trigger areas as defined in TrenchBroom</li>
            <li>The loading and implementing of event triggers as defined in Trenchbroom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With the implementation of these features, we were able to create interesting and interactive levels in the style of the 
            first Quake game.

        <h2>Bullet physics implementation</h2>
        <p>
            For the physics of the Wombat engine, we decided to make use of the Bullet physics library. I had worked with this library 
            before, so using this previous knowledge I was able to set it up quite fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using Bullet I implemented the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The capsule collider for the player</li>
            <li>The mesh collider for the Level loaded from a BSP</li>
            <li>Raycasts</li>
            <li>Trigger boxes that notify connected objects when they have been entered</li>
            <li>Collision event callbacks to notify objects a collision occurred</li>
            <li>Collision groups for enabling/disabling collisions between certain groups</li>
        </ul>
