            The wombat combat FPS engine is an engine based on the quake engine and it uses trench broom as its level editor. 
            I worked on this project with a team of 7 programmers for the duration of half a school year.

        <p>
            One of my responsibilities for this project was to load the data stored in the .BSP files and make it usable for our 
            engine. For this, I looked through the source code of the quake engine, and with some help, I managed to implement the 
            loading of levels.

        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <p>
            For the physics in our engine, we make use of the bullet physics library. Implementing this was originally somebody 
            else their task, but when they were unable to take care of this task, I took over the task. While working with Bullet 
            in our project we ran into many issues where Bullet would crash when certain collisions happened. I eventually managed 
            to fix these issues and in the end, we were able to deliver a stable enough build of our project which was greatly 
            enjoyed at playday.
