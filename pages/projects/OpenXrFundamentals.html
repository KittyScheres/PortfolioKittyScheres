            For one of my self-study projects during school, I learned about the <b>OpenXR standard for VR/AR devices</b> and how 
            to implement it for my projects. To do this, I followed the tutorial created by the Kronos group. This tutorial 
            provides a broad overview of the different methods for interacting with VR/AR devices and how to create applications for them. 
            By the end of the tutorial, I created a VR application where the player can move around boxes that represent a floor and a 
            table. Above the table, some cubes can be picked up and moved by the player. There are also cubes where the player's hands 
            are in the real world.
