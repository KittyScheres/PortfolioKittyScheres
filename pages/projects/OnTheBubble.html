            On the bubble is the project I worked on for most of my third year at BUAS. 
            It is a custom engine project that we are creating for a game that is inspired by Super Monkey Ball. 
            The main selling points for our project are that it makes use of Raytracing and that there is a big focus on user-generated 
            content where users can create and share custom levels that are created using our custom build level editor.

            One of my responsibilities in this project is to implement the Mod.io SDK and set it up within our project. 
            Mod.io is a service for hosting user-generated content. By using the SDK, a user can upload, download, and manage 
            custom levels for our game. For this, I created an abstraction class in our engine that is used by the game to interact 
            with the Mod.io service without needing to know the specifics of the Mod.io SDK.

            Another one of my responsibilities on the project was to implement an undo and redo functionality for our level editor. 
            To implement this, I used the command design pattern for creating definitions of actions that can be performed in the 
            level editor. I collect the performed actions in a stack of actions when an action needs to be undone the undo function 
            and the action at the top of the stack is called. If the action needs to be redone, the redo function is called. 
            If a new action is performed after actions have been undone, the undone actions are invalidated. If the stack is full 
            and a new action needs to be added, the action at the bottom of the stack is removed.
