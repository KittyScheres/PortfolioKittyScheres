            Camp Champ is a game I worked on during the second half of my second year at the Breda University of Applied Sciences. 
            Development of this project started with <b>4 weeks of concepting</b> and the remaining <b>8 weeks were spent on developing 
            and releasing</b> the game. During these 8 weeks, I was both a <b>gameplay programmer</b> and the <b>tech lead</b> 
            for this project. I worked on this project with <b>13 other developers</b>, including 1 producer and 2 leads for the other 
            diciplines. The project was made using the <b>Unreal engine</b> and the <b>blueprints visual scripting language</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Camp Champ is a 2v2 local co-op game where you play a game of capture the flag. The team that captured the most flags 
            when the time runs out wins. During the match items will spawn to aid you in the capturing of the opponentâ€™s flag. These 
            items range from a fishing rod to a powerful bazooka.

        <h2>Lead work</h2>
        <p>
            As a tech lead my work was split up between technical duties and general lead duties.
        </p>
        <p>
            As tech lead, my duties revolved around maintaining the quality of technical pipelines in our project. Specifically, 
            those around the project itself, our version control, and our task management board. But it would also happen in the way 
            of providing insight into the technical aspects of decisions that would be discussed during meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            My general lead duties revolved around making sure the team could do their work effectively without much issue. To do 
            this the other leads and I took care of hosting the required scrum rituals (sprint planning, stand up, sprint 
            retrospective) and meetings that were needed to make decisions for the project. Another way we helped the team was by 
            supporting communication within the team and working on the resolution of conflicts that happened during the development 
            of the game.

        <h2>Gameplay work</h2>
        <p>
            My work as a gameplay programmer was split between the implementation of gameplay features and the fixing of bugs in the 
            game. Here are some highlights of the features I worked on.
        </p>

            <h3>Flag system</h3>
            <p>
                One of my main contributions to this project was the creation of the flag system. This includes the bases where the 
                flags are stored and the flag-carrying behaviour of the players.
            </p>
            <p>
                A flag has 3 states: blue, red, and neutral. When a flag has been put down inside of a team's base, only players 
                from the other team can pick up the flag. In this case, the flag is either in its blue or red state. If a player 
                drops the flag while carrying it because they got hit, the flag goes into a neutral state where both teams can pick 
                it up. The only exception to this is the player that dropped the flag, they must wait a bit before they can pick up 
                the flag again.

            <h3>Team selection UI</h3>
            <p>
                Another feature I worked on is the team selection UI. Here players select what team they want to be assigned to by 
                pressing the left or right d-pad button on their controller. Each team can have a maximum of 2 people. When a player 
                chooses a valid team, the portrait displays the character they play as when the game starts.
