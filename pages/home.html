                    Hi, my name is Kitty Scheres.
                </span>
                <span>
                    I am a generalist games programmer with an interest in virtual reality games. 
                    I have 6.5 years of programming experience, of which 2.5 are game-related. During my education at Breda University 
                    of Applied Sciences, I have worked on a couple solo and team-based projects.

                    According to team members I have worked with in the past, I am enjoyable to work with. I am eager to share my 
                    knowledge on a subject when this is relevant, I work to create a positive environment for me and my team members, 
                    and I provide insightful feedback.
                </span>
                <span>
                    While I enjoy working on all kinds of projects, I would like to work on more virtual reality projects as I am 
                    passionate about the technology and think that it has a lot of potential as a tool for entertainment.
